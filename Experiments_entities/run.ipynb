However, there is insufficient evidence to suggest that cocaine causes significant changes in female fertility.2) It is not clear how long cocaine remains in semen or blood after use. Therefore, it is difficult to say exactly when it will be completely gone from your husbands body.3) There is no data regarding the amount of time that couples need to abstain from sexual activity before attempting conception.4) In conclusion, if you want to become pregnant, then you should avoid coke for at least three months before trying to conceive.

       " {'input': 'Hello doctor,My son has developed anxiety symptoms about four years ago. They came completely out of the blue. He was with someone who now has heart palpitations, sweaty palms and feet, and lightheadedness sitting in the living room. We ran a battery of tests when it first happened including TSH, EKG, lung scans, blood panels, etc. and everything was normal. So we went down the path of anxiety. Four years later, the symptoms continued. As my son now has a terrible fear of doctors, we tried a home blood test to get a full thyroid panel. I have attached the results.The blood work came back normal. Low normal TSH, but low normal T4 and lower normal free T4 and free T3. There is nothing that shows an abnormality. However, his urine test showed moderately low iodine and slightly low selenium. I have read that abnormalities in these measures could cause thyroid problems. What am I wondering is if these two indicators are worth further exploration with an endocrinologist knowing that going to the doctor will cause my son a severe panic.Also, is it possible that low iodine could have been a temporary diet thing and it is masking the signs of hyperthyroidism in the blood work? He has all of the symptoms of someone with hyperthyroidism.

       "  'answer_chatdoctor': 'Hi, Thanks for writing in. The blood levels of thyroid hormones are not always accurate in people with anxiety. In such cases, an ultrasound scan of the neck can be done which can help in differentiating between a normal thyroid gland and enlargement of the thyroid gland due to inflammation or goiter. In case of enlargement of the thyroid gland, the treatment is simple. It consists of taking anti-inflammatory medicines like steroids along with thyroxine. This is called as subclinical hyperthyroidism. In case of thyroiditis, the thyroid function tests may come back normal but there might be some changes seen on thyroid ultrasound. These are transient conditions and resolve over a period of time without any specific treatment. Do discuss the above with your doctor. Hope this helps.',\n",

It may occur during sexual arousal or orgasm due to increased blood flow to the brain. During erection, the penis is filled with blood and causes pressure changes in the bladder leading to urinary retention. Sometimes, this can cause sudden pressure on the abdomen leading to chest pain and breathing difficulty. So, in short, these symptoms may be related to any of the above reasons. But, since you have been diagnosed with ectopic beats, I would strongly recommend going for further investigations. ECG, stress test, echo etc. should be done to rule out cardiac problems. A psychiatrist consultation would help treat any associated anxiety issues. Hope this helps.',\n",

Unfortunately with labor day being this weekend I have been unable to see my regular OBGYN. But I did go to the ER to confirm the pregnancy 2 days ago. So my blood results came back with an HCG OF 248 and the doctor said I am right around 1-2 weeks.So, here is my question. I have been stressing out badly due to the fact I have been on Lorazepam 1 mg every night for anxiety and PD for the last 2 years as well as Percocet 10 mg as needed for back pain. I have been taking both of the medications during my pregnancy when I had no idea I was pregnant. Since finding out I have tried tapering on both medications. The Percocet is making me sweat and very agitated and when I tried to cut down on the Lorazepam I was shaking and almost hallucinating and delusion. I also tried not taking the Lorazepam at all and woke up crying, shaking and sweating. I want to be off both these medicines but I am worried more about the Lorazepam as it is a class D pregnancy drug. I have read about the terrible problems this causes for infants. I am so scared that I am considering abortion. I do not want to be a terrible mother before I even give birth. I have been having bad panic attacks over this and cannot seem to relax as the complications of these medicines are always on my mind. Any advice at all would be very much appreciated.',\n",
       "  'answer_chatdoctor': 'Hi, Thanks for posting in Chat Doctor. I understand your concern. Lorazepam is a benzodiazepine which is a group C teratogen, meaning it can cause harm to the fetus. It should not be taken during pregnancy if possible. However, there are some women who may need it for their health, and they will have to weigh risks vs benefits. If you were taking Lorazepam only, you might consider taking it while pregnant. You could try switching to another anti-anxiety medicine such as clonazepam or alprazolam. These two are considered safe during early pregnancy. In addition, you should continue to take your other medication such as percocet. This can help reduce the symptoms of nausea, headache etc. Hope this helps. Take care.',\n",
